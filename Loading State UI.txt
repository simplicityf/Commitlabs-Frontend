UI Feedback & Loading States System

Role: UI/UX Designer
Type: Design System · Components
Focus: Clarity · Responsiveness · User Feedback

Overview

I designed a reusable feedback and loading states system to improve perceived performance and user confidence across product flows. The system standardizes how the interface communicates progress, status, and completion during actions such as form submissions, transactions, and data fetching.

Design Goals

Provide clear feedback during wait states

Reduce user uncertainty during async actions

Maintain visual consistency across the product

Build reusable, scalable UI components

Components Designed
Loading Indicators

A set of spinners and progress bars designed for different contexts and screen densities.

Small, default, and large spinner variants

Determinate and indeterminate progress bars

Minimal motion to avoid distraction

Interactive States

Clear status buttons that communicate system behavior in real time:

Processing – action in progress

Saving – temporary data persistence

Connecting – network-dependent actions

Success – completed actions with confirmation feedback

Each state uses color, iconography, and motion to reinforce meaning while remaining accessible.

Skeleton States

Skeleton cards designed to replace empty screens while content loads.

Mirrors final layout to reduce layout shift

Improves perceived loading speed

Keeps users oriented while data is fetched

Design Decisions

Neutral backgrounds to reduce visual noise

Consistent spacing and border radius across components

Accessible color contrast for all states

Components designed for easy handoff to developers
