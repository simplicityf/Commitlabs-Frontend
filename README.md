## 🔭 Overview

CommitLabs allows users to create, manage, and trade liquidity commitments. These commitments are on-chain contracts that lock assets for a specified duration in exchange for yield, with specific compliance and risk parameters.

This frontend interacts with the CommitLabs Soroban smart contracts to:
1.  Create new commitments with customizable parameters (Safe, Balanced, Aggressive).
2.  Monitor the health and performance of existing commitments.
3.  Trade commitments on a secondary marketplace.

## ✨ Features

-   **Commitment Creation Wizard**: Step-by-step process to configure asset, amount, duration, and risk parameters.
-   **Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of commitment health, including value history, drawdown, and compliance scores.
-   **Marketplace**: Browse and filter active commitments available for purchase.
-   **Wallet Integration**: Connect with Stellar wallets (e.g., Freighter) to sign transactions (In Progress).
-   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🏗 Architecture

The application is built using the **Next.js App Router** architecture.

-   **Framework**: Next.js 14
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v4) with CSS Modules for component-specific styles.
-   **State Management**: React Context & Hooks (Local state for forms).
-   **Blockchain Interaction**: `@stellar/stellar-sdk` and `@stellar/freighter-api` (via `src/utils/soroban.ts`).
-   **Data Visualization**: `recharts` for health metrics and performance charts.

## Security Headers

This project includes a reusable helper to attach standard security headers to HTTP responses.

**Usage:**

1. Import the helper:
   ```typescript
   import { attachSecurityHeaders } from '@/utils/response';
   ```

2. Wrap your response object before returning it in a route handler:
   ```typescript
   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
   import { attachSecurityHeaders } from '@/utils/response';

   export async function GET() {
     const response = NextResponse.json({ data: 'secure content' });
     return attachSecurityHeaders(response);
   }
   ```

**Customization:**

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** You can override the default CSP by passing a second argument.
  ```typescript
  return attachSecurityHeaders(response, "default-src 'none'; img-src 'self'");
  ```

- **Disabling/Modifying Headers:**
  The `attachSecurityHeaders` function returns the modified `Response` object. You can further modify headers on the returned object if needed, or update the `src/utils/response.ts` file to change default behaviors globally.
